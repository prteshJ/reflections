When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local
since it allows me to take benefit of the cloud. Even if my local machine runs 
into issues and I lose my work still I have no issues since my work is safely 
backed up to the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I do it automatically, I lose control and I may not be able to commit
my work to Github per logical change but there would be lots of unnecessary
commits which really could be avoided. I would want to do it manually since
I can push my work per logical change and I am in control and charge of my
commits.
